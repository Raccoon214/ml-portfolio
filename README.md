# 🧠 Machine Learning Portfolio
A curated collection of my completed Data Science and Machine Learning projects.  
This portfolio highlights my technical range across supervised learning, unsupervised learning, natural language processing, and deep learning — with a focus on building real, practical solutions.

---

## 🚀 About This Portfolio
This repository showcases the projects I consider representative of my best work up top date.  
Each project includes:

- Clean and well-documented Jupyter notebooks  
- Clear problem definitions and business framing  
- Reproducible code and model pipelines  
- Visualizations and performance metrics  
- A structured README inside each project folder  

My goal is to demonstrate **strong technical skill**, **clear communication**, and **a practical, human-centered approach** to data science and machine learning.

## 📂 Featured Projects
Below are the core projects included in this portfolio. Each project folder contains its own detailed documentation.

### 1. **Natural Language Processing**
*Dialogue Summarization with Transformer Models | Seq2Seq | BERT Encoder-Decoder | ROUGE Evaluation*  
A fine-tuned transformer model that generates human-like summaries of multi-turn dialogues. Includes experimentation with tokenizers, training strategies, and evaluation metrics.

### 2. **Supervised Classification**
*NFL Passing Play Prediction | Feature Engineering | Model Comparison*  
A predictive model analyzing NFL play-by-play and tracking data to classify whether a play will be a pass or run. Focuses on CRISP-DM workflow, advanced feature engineering, and model interpretability.

### 3. **Regression Model & Risk Forecasting**
*Exploratory Data Analysis | Geospatial Visualization | Tableau Dashboard*  
A large-scale EDA project uncovering patterns in accidents across states, weather conditions, and time. Includes geospatial mapping and interactive Tableau dashboards for stakeholder communication.
